Hello, this is the Developer Instructions. I will be showwing you all the imports, installs, and anything else you need before editing the code.

Note - I say "pip" alot in this, the pip commandf is for windows ONLY, if you are on mac you will have to use "pip3".

===================

# Installs Needed...

# How to convert the python file to a application...

Start by typing "pip install pyinstaller" in your Windows/Mac terminal.
Then type "pyinstaller --onefile --windowed browser.py" (switch the browser.py with whatever your code is saved as)

For my mac users you WIll need to install developer tools to convert thew file, run this command "xcode-select --install"

After you run these commands you should have an appliction called "Modo" in your application folder.
