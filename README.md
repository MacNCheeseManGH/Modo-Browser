# Modo-Browser
Modo is a free to use open source browser by MacNCheeseManGH.


Also please exuse the fact that its called "Blacklisted Browser" when you open it, when coding this is VS Code I had it under the wrong folder and I really dont feel like re-doing the whole setup.  

# Common Q&A...

"Why did you make Modo?" - I made Modo because Chrome loves to eat memory and I have a low end PC so it was not going to work. (If you are wondering about why I dont use other browsers its becuase I am a minimalist and I have anxiety so thats why Modo only has Open/Close tab functions and other things that are just the bare minimum of what a browser could be)

"Why should I use this?" - Modo offers a low-end browsing experience for those who dub themselfs "Minimalists" (Like myself0. It also has some pretty cool open source features so you can mod the browser.

"Is Modo a virus?" - No, Modo is not a Virus, its just a bunch of python files grouped together by me so I can stop have panic attacks when i see chrome is using 99% memory (We have all been there ðŸ’€)

"Whats the difference between the Modo Python File and the App download?" - The App download is for those who just wish to use the browser, the python file is for those who plan on editing my code or "modding" it. I have no issue with people modding it just dont go too crazy.

If you have any questions please contact me :)
