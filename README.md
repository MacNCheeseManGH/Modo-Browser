# Modo-Browser
Modo is a free to use open source browser by MacNCheeseCoder. It has many features (read about all the features in the About.txt File)


Also please exuse the fact that its called "Blacklisted Browser" when you open it, when coding this is VS Code I had it under the wrong folder and I really dont feel like re-doing to whole setup.  

Browser Extentions are coming soon.
